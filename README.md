# Raspberry-Display
This is an application i wrote for displaying pc status on a raspberry pi with a HDMI display plugged into it.
I wrote this software soly for myself. This repo only exists so i dont loose it.
Feel free to do anything you want with it, no warrenty etc etc. Nothing is documented because i am dumb.
P.S.: The applet does nothing
